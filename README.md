# Challenge 1 : You are given a theoretical 8x8 LED panel and an array of 8 bytes, each byte representing a row of the panel. Your task is to take the array of bytes and output it as a matrix of characters, where 1 is represented by ‘ # ’ and 0 is represented by ‘ . ’. The preferred way of solving this problem is by using bit shifting and bitwise operations.
# Challenge 2 : You are given a structure which needs to be serialized. You need to write a function to take an instance of the given structure and return a byte array with the seri-alized object.Input structure: typedef struct {char[10] source;int id;unsignedlongtimestamp;int temperature;int humidity;int pressure;} measurement_t;measurement_tmeasurements;
# Challenge 3 : You are given a data structure containing multiple data types and access to a serial driver API. Your task is to write the body of the `get_sensor_data` function in order to store the retrieved data. This exercise is NOT aimed towards the candidate's algorithmic skills, but rather to their attention to detail and their ability to make use of the tools at their disposal. As a result, this problem does not have any inputs but has an expected output as a way to check if they implemented the function correctly. The candidate should make use of the available files and comments in order to solve this challenge.  The files necessary for this challenge can be found inside the serial directory.
